# Dec. 19

"Where is salvation? Where is light?"

A caged owl mourns o'er the curse of night.

Its plumes stained with solitary dreams.

Man can hear nought but its desolate screams.



"What calamity has descended upon my fate!"

The fierce frost spreads across its vacant heart,

For it perceives no more the universal dance.

Everything becomes empty howl in a trance.



"The violets bloom after winter's decay,

Like true love made truer by its rarity.

Tis through thy mind's eye life completes."

A skylark soars and sings at heaven's gate.



As extinguished flames rekindled by thunder,

The owl breaks the cage with a song of wonder,

"Embrace the elevation! Behold my delight!

For nothing can impede the Spirit of Might!"
