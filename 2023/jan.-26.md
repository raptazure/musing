One important factor that leads me to fall in love with English poems in the first place might be the rhythmic patterns based on stress. The sound of a poem is the beating of a heart, the primordial music of an ancient past, the overflowing energy of life even after dusk. I guess that's why iambic pentameter offers the natural source of musicality for the English language. It is the sound within every one of us, since life itself begins.
