One important factor that leads me to fall in love with English poems might be the rhythmic patterns based on stress. The sound of a poem is the beating of a heart, the primordial music of an ancient past, the overflowing energy of life even after dusk. I guess that's why iambic pentameter offers the natural source of musicality for the English language. It is the sound within every one of us, since life itself begins. Another important factor might be the emphasis of enlightenment contained in its poetic tradition, which originates from the ancient Hebrew Prophets. This kind of poetry is beyond merely picturesque descriptive language and displays of delicate sensations, but instead opens a portal towards the sublime and the divine.
