Quote: _Poetic Diction_ by Owen Barfield

> Without the continued existence of poetry, without a steady influx of new meaning into language, even the knowledge and wisdom which poetry herself has given in the past must wither away into a species of mechanical calculation.&#x20;
>
> Great poetry is the progressive incarnation of life into consciousness.

So, the causation and the solution is pretty clear now.

「诗歌」拯救我们，我们也要拯救「她」。
