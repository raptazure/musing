I shall not indulge myself in poetic fancies in a merely playful manner, but instead I shall inspire to be the vessel of higher aspirations, to receive what is beyond me and to reach out for more. Poetry of this age is to be the poetry of enlightenment, of spiritual awakening, of discovering the World and Word once again.

Yet, does this _consciously constructed_ vision produce a restraining effect upon the making and discovering of poetry itself? After all, poetry is free and everywhere...

Maybe... just listen to the words of spirits, like an aeolian harp suspended in the air, waiting for the breath of music. What is to come will come. That's quite enough for me.
