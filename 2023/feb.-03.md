I shall not indulge myself in poetic fancies in a merely playful manner, but instead I shall inspire to be the vessel of higher aspirations, to receive what is beyond me and to reach out for more. Poetry of this age is to be the poetry of enlightenment, of spiritual awakening, of discovering the World and Word once again.

_Refl._ Yet, does this _consciously constructed_ vision produce a restraining effect upon the making and discovering of poetry itself? After all, poetry is free-moving, universal and everywhere. It is not to be restricted by a specific mode of expression, for the inner energy of the word "poetry" represents the totality of the creative force resided in the human breast and all the possibilities of co-creation with the divine eternal.

Maybe, listening to the words of spirits, even as an aeolian harp suspended in the air, waiting for the breath of music, is quite enough. What is to come will come.
