Poetry is so astonishing an art that it can work on your personality in the subconscious level. When I'm reading Shelley's works intensely, I get more passionate & emotional without apparent external causes and when I'm reading _The Divine Comedy_, a certain touch of serenity naturally flows into my heart. However, all these effects make sense when you consider the nature of poetry, which is a mode of experience, just like life itself.
