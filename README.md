> "The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,&#x20;
>
> Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;&#x20;
>
> And as imagination bodies forth&#x20;

> The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen&#x20;
>
> Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing&#x20;
>
> A local habitation and a name."
