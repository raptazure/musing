The change of Shelley's conception of God and divinity reminds me of C.S. Lewis' conversion from an atheist to a Christian. It is to find the reconciliation between reason and imagination and to recognize the synthetic power of imagination, especially in face of the unknown. Here is a poem written by C.S. Lewis which explores the relationship of these two faculties in the human mind:

> Set on the soul's acropolis the reason stands&#x20;
>
> A virgin, arm'd, commercing with celestial light,&#x20;
>
> And he who sins against her has defiled his own&#x20;
>
> Virginity: no cleansing makes his garment white;&#x20;
>
> So clear is reason. But how dark, imagining,&#x20;
>
> Warm, dark, obscure and infinite, daughter of Night:&#x20;
>
> Dark is her brow, the beauty of her eyes with sleep&#x20;
>
> Is loaded and her pains are long, and her delight.&#x20;
>
> Tempt not Athene. Wound not in her fertile pains&#x20;
>
> Demeter, nor rebel against her mother-right.&#x20;
>
> Oh who will reconcile in me both maid and mother,&#x20;
>
> Who make in me a concord of the depth and height?&#x20;
>
> Who make imagination's dim exploring touch&#x20;
>
> Ever report the same as intellectual sight?&#x20;
>
> Then could I truly say, and not deceive,&#x20;
>
> Then wholly say, that I B E L I E V E.
