- Writing:

  - The feeble images of dissolution spread across our hearts.

    How can we behold again the lost realms of ancient past?

    Tis no more... 

    Only, a wanderer meandering through the dense forest of decay

    Full of poisonous thorns and pernicious scorns,

    Is left, weeping for days

    That are no more...

    O, never more....

    

    Yet, a heart pure is yearning still

    For more, quivering & beating still,

    Like a rill that is full of dark currents

    And unseen passions, flows

    Through the world

    Of restlessness...

###### Jan. 19

- Listening: Richard Holmes: Coleridge, The Ancient Mariner, Bristol and Beyond (Coleridge Lectures 2015)
- Reading: The Divine Comedy - Paradise Canto XXI
- Speaking: Reading - The Divine Comedy - Paradise Canto XXI
- Writing: Poetry is so astonishing an art that it can work on your personality in the subconscious level. When I'm reading Shelley's works intensely, I get more passionate & emotional without apparent external causes and when I'm reading *The Divine Comedy*, a certain touch of serenity  naturally flows into my heart. However, all these effects make sense when you consider the nature of poetry, which is a mode of experience, just like life itself.
- Vocabulary: albatross / dragoon / idyllic
